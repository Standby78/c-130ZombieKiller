- generate bunker entrance
- generate zombies, define paths for each or one wide path, with multiple random displacement points
  - defined zombie random Z generation - done, zombie class
  - defined one straigth path toward endpoint, create path in segments, use lineCurve3 to account for Y changes
    due to different height points - DONE
    - use pathfinder.js for getting array indices for path, and get heightmaps values for said indices - DONE
      - create an array of path elements in the constructor, loop through them - DONE
- shoot zombies, create new one on kill - done
- generate regions for houses and nature, on voronoi cells (one "central" cell, and 7-8 "outside" cells) - done
- divide central cell in regions, for specific buildings (small farm or small village, for example) - done
- generate roads using spline extrusions, make them connect at right angles if more roads are present
- generate crop fields using into consideration the y displacement of land triangles
- texture different triangles depending on slope, higher angles should look like rock ridges
- generate house on game map, check for trees first

bugs:
 - y os zombija i dalje nije ok, prolazi kroz teren - isto kao drva
 - y os stabla nije ok, stabla koja su na padini su preduboko - prestrmi mi je teren, ako sam ispod 0.017
    ispada jo≈° i ok
